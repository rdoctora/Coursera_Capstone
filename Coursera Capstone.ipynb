The key stakeholder will be the Director of Operations who is interested in opening a *sushi restaurant* in *San Francisco, California, USA*. \n\nThe Director has specified two criteria: first, as San Francisco is an international destination with many eateries, the Director has specifically requested a location *not crowded with competitor cuisines*. Second, since the raw materials and ingredients for maintaining a restaurant of the chain's calibre are expensive, the Director would also prefer a city location *with low theft rates*. Since the chain maintains an active Loss Prevention program with specialized equipment, a location with low crime theft over the past 5 years is acceptable.\n\nWe will be analyzing locations in San Francisco as well as crime data to support the restaurant chain's initiative. We will then present pros and cons of areas selected and provide recommendations to the stakeholders."

For the second criteria, we will use the public San Francisco crimes data to investigate theft and robberies by location to present a proposal for site selection.\n\nWe decided to use key district parameters to define San Francisco locations since San Francisco is no larger than approximately 7 miles by 7 miles. Data sources initially planned for extraction and generation include:\n* number of eateries and their type by San Francisco location will be obtained using **Foursquare API**\n* theft locations of the city will be used and overlayed onto a San Franciso **Folium map** for analysis and analysis"
